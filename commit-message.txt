feat(ui): integrate adaptive chat demo with client components

# Description
This commit integrates the adaptive chat UI demo into the main application structure
with proper Next.js client component directives. It ensures all components using 
React hooks are properly configured with 'use client' directives as required by Next.js 15.

# Changes
- Added 'use client' directive to all React components using hooks
- Updated page.tsx to correctly use dynamic imports with client components
- Added Jest testing infrastructure to validate component quality
- Created test scripts to ensure all components follow project standards
- Added architectural documentation with Mermaid diagrams

# Design Principles
This implementation adheres to our biophilic design principles with:
- Natural color palette (deep teal, amber accents, sage green tertiary elements)
- Organic styling with subtle gradients and natural transitions
- Enhanced understanding framework with intention detection and entity recognition

# Quality Assurance
- Ensured all components are properly linted with correct React hook usage
- Added automated tests to prevent future regressions
- Maintained function size under 50 lines for clarity
- Documented component architecture for easier maintenance

# Testing
- Added tests to verify client component configuration
- Added quality validation tests for code standards
- Manually tested UI rendering and interactivity
