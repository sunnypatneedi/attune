# TypeScript 7.0 Migration Guide

## Overview

TypeScript 7.0 is a significant upgrade that includes a complete rewrite of the TypeScript compiler in Go, offering up to 10x performance improvements. This document outlines the steps we've taken to prepare our codebase for TypeScript 7.0 and provides guidance on further optimizations.

## Key Changes in TypeScript 7.0

- **Native Implementation**: The compiler has been rewritten in Go, dramatically improving performance
- **Build Speed**: Up to 10x faster compilation times
- **Editor Experience**: 8x improvement in project load time
- **Memory Usage**: Roughly half of the current implementation
- **LSP Integration**: Moving to Language Server Protocol for better language service integration

## Preparatory Changes Made

We've updated our TypeScript configuration to align with best practices for TypeScript 7.0 compatibility:

1. Updated target to ES2020
2. Added `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` for more explicit import/export handling
3. Added `useDefineForClassFields: true` for modern class field semantics
4. Added `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` for stricter type checking

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Update Code for Type Safety

- Review and fix any type errors that emerge from stricter settings
- Avoid using deprecated APIs that will be removed in TypeScript 7.0
- Use explicit type annotations where inference might be ambiguous

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- Split large files into smaller, modular components
- Reduce type complexity in heavily used interfaces
- Simplify conditional types where possible
- Use `Pick` and `Omit` instead of extensive intersection types

### 3. Module System Best Practices

- Use explicit imports instead of namespace imports
- Avoid side effects in module initialization
- Consider using path mapping for cleaner imports
- Use `import type` for type-only imports

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Create a separate TypeScript 7.0 test workflow to verify compatibility
- Run performance benchmarks with both TypeScript 6.x and 7.0
- Document any functionality differences encountered

## Monitoring and Feedback

As TypeScript 7.0 approaches official release, we should:

1. Monitor the TypeScript GitHub repository for migration guides
2. Test with beta/RC versions when available
3. Report any issues encountered to the TypeScript team
4. Update our internal documentation with lessons learned
