  - Accessibility-first approach to component development

### State Management
- **React Hooks**
  - useState for local component state
  - useEffect for side effects and lifecycle management
  - useContext for theme and configuration propagation
  - Custom hooks for shared logic

- **Event Bus System**
  - Custom publish-subscribe pattern implementation
  - Component-to-component communication
  - Cross-cutting concerns management

### Natural Language Processing

  - Integration with editor tools
  - Pre-commit hooks

### Development Environment
- **VS Code Recommended Setup**
  - Extensions for React/TypeScript development
  - Debugging configurations
  - Recommended settings

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Methodology**
  - Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
  - Molecules: Combinations of atoms (message bubbles, input groups)
  - Organisms: Complex UI sections (chat containers, control panels)
  - Templates: Page layouts and structure
  - Pages: Complete views combining organisms and templates

### Data Flow Architecture
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**
  - State flows down through component hierarchy
  - Events flow up through callbacks
  - Predictable state management

### Service Layer
- **Module-based Service Organization**
  - Enhanced Understanding Framework service
  - Event Bus service
  - Storage/persistence service
  - Animation coordination service

### CSS Architecture
- **Component-Scoped CSS**
  - Modular CSS approach
  - Component-specific style encapsulation
  - Shared variables for consistency
  - Utility classes for common patterns

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### Hosting Options

  - Edge network deployment
  - Continuous deployment from Git
  - Preview deployments for PRs

- **Containerized Deployment**
  - Docker containerization support
  - Kubernetes orchestration compatibility
  - Environment configuration through variables

### Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting**
  - Route-based code splitting
  - Component-level dynamic imports
  - Library chunking

- **Image Optimization**
  - Next.js image optimization
  - WebP format support
  - Responsive image serving

- **Caching Strategy**
  - Static generation where appropriate
  - Incremental static regeneration
  - API response caching

## Integration Points
