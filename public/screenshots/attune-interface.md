# Attune Interface Screenshot

This is a placeholder file indicating where the screenshot of the Attune interface should be placed.

To create a proper screenshot:
1. Run the application locally with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001 in your browser
3. Take a screenshot of the interface showing a sample conversation
4. Save the image as `attune-interface.png` in the `/public/screenshots/` directory
5. Update the README.md to point to this image

The screenshot should showcase the biophilic design elements, adaptive UI components, and the conversational interface that makes Attune unique.
